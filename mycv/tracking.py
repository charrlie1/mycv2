MultiObjectKalmanTracker : Track multiple simultaneous objects with IDs

Mathematical background
-----------------------
Motion detection computes the absolute per-pixel intensity difference
between two consecutive frames and thresholds it, detecting locations
where the scene has changed.  Correct uint8 subtraction requires a safe
path to avoid unsigned integer underflow.

Colour masking treats HSV as a 3-D bounded box query: a pixel is
"inside" the target colour if each of its three channel values lies
within the specified lower and upper bounds simultaneously.

Centroid estimation is the discrete 2-D expected value of pixel
coordinates weighted by the binary mask — equivalent to the arithmetic
mean of all foreground pixel positions. For scenes with multiple
disjoint objects of the same colour, prefer
`morphology.label_connected_components` + `morphology.component_properties`
to get one centroid per object instead of a single averaged blob.

Temporal smoothing averages the last N frames along the time axis using
a pre-allocated circular (ring) buffer, which avoids O(N) memory shifts
on every update and achieves constant-time writes via modulo indexing.

Kalman filtering provides optimal recursive state estimation for linear
Gaussian systems. For centroid tracking, we model position and velocity
as a 4-D state vector [x, y, vx, vy] with constant-velocity dynamics.
The filter alternates between prediction (projecting state forward in
time) and update (correcting prediction with noisy measurements).

    Compute a binary motion mask from two consecutive grayscale frames.

    The uint8 underflow problem
    ---------------------------
    NumPy uint8 arrays are stored as unsigned 8-bit integers in [0, 255].
    Subtracting two uint8 values wraps around modulo 256:

        frame_t[y, x]         = 10   (dark pixel, current frame)
        frame_t_minus_1[y, x] = 200  (bright pixel, previous frame)
        difference (uint8)    = 10 - 200  =>  66  (wraps: 256 - 190 = 66)

    The correct absolute difference is 190, not 66.  Direct uint8
    subtraction silently produces a wrong positive value wherever
    frame_t < frame_t_minus_1, masking real motion as a small number
    and corrupting the threshold decision.

    Safe solution
    -------------
    Cast both frames to int16 (signed, range -32768..32767) before
    subtracting so that no underflow can occur, then apply np.abs to
    produce the true absolute difference, and finally cast back to uint8.
    The entire pipeline is a sequence of vectorised NumPy operations
    with no Python-level loop:

        diff = |int16(frame_t) - int16(frame_t_minus_1)|

    Thresholding is then a single boolean comparison multiplied by 255:

        mask(x,y) = 255  if  diff(x,y) >= threshold,  else 0

) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Create a binary mask for pixels within an HSV colour range.

    This replaces cv2.inRange with pure NumPy logical operations.

    A pixel at (y, x) is foreground iff its HSV triple
    (H, S, V) satisfies ALL three simultaneous inequalities:

        lower_bound[0] <= H(y,x) <= upper_bound[0]   (Hue)
        lower_bound[1] <= S(y,x) <= upper_bound[1]   (Saturation)
        lower_bound[2] <= V(y,x) <= upper_bound[2]   (Value)

    This is equivalent to testing membership in the axis-aligned 3-D
    box [lower_bound, upper_bound] in HSV space.  Each inequality is
    evaluated as a vectorised NumPy comparison producing a (H, W) bool
    array; the three pairs are combined with bitwise AND (&) to enforce
    the simultaneous requirement without any Python-level loop.

    Hue wrap-around note
    --------------------
    Hue is periodic (red spans both 0 deg and 360 deg).  If
    lower_bound[0] > upper_bound[0] (e.g., lower=330, upper=30 for red),
    this function alone treats it as an empty (never-true) range,
    because a single AND-combined interval cannot represent a wrapped
    range. Use `color_mask_hue_wrap` instead, which detects the wrapped
    case automatically and ORs together the two non-wrapping sub-ranges.

    Build a colour mask from a sampled mean HSV colour, automatically
    switching between hue-based and saturation/value-based thresholding
    depending on how saturated the sampled colour is.

    Why this matters: hue is unreliable for near-white/gray/black colours
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Hue is the angular position around the HSV colour wheel, and the
    formula that computes it (see `color.rgb_to_hsv`) divides by
    `delta = V - Cmin`, i.e. by the amount of colour difference between a
    pixel's channels. For a genuinely saturated colour (e.g. a red or
    blue object) delta is large and hue is numerically stable. But for a
    white, gray, or black object, R, G, and B are all nearly equal, so
    delta is small — ordinary camera sensor noise (or lighting/JPEG
    artifacts) of just a few intensity levels between channels gets
    divided by that small delta and the resulting hue swings wildly,
    essentially at random, across the full 0-360 degree range. (Measured
    empirically: a purely white patch under mild synthetic sensor noise
    has a hue STANDARD DEVIATION of over 100 degrees — far wider than any
    reasonable hue tolerance window.)

    A hue-window mask built from a single sampled hue therefore only
    picks up a small, essentially arbitrary, noise-correlated fragment of
    a white/gray/black object (e.g. it might catch only a coloured logo
    printed on it, or a stray corner) instead of segmenting the object as
    a whole — producing a tiny, non-representative bounding box and
    corrupting downstream shape/circularity measurement.

    This function detects that case (`mean_s < achromatic_saturation`)
    and, for it ONLY, thresholds purely on Saturation and Value — keep
    any pixel that is similarly desaturated and similarly bright,
    ignoring hue entirely, since hue carries no usable information for an
    achromatic colour. For genuinely saturated colours, it falls through
    to ordinary hue-windowed masking (via `color_mask_hue_wrap`, so hue
    wrap-around near 0/360 degrees is still handled automatically).

    ----------
    hsv_image  : np.ndarray  shape (H, W, 3) — output of `color.rgb_to_hsv`

def calculate_centroid(
    binary_mask: np.ndarray,
) -> tuple:
    """
    Calculate the 2-D centroid (centre of mass) of a binary mask.

    Mathematical definition
    -----------------------
    Given a binary mask M : Omega -> {0, 1} with foreground pixel set

        F = { (y, x) in Omega : M(y, x) = 1 }

    the centroid is the expected value of the coordinate distribution:

        x_c = (1/|F|)  *  sum_{(y,x) in F}  x
        y_c = (1/|F|)  *  sum_{(y,x) in F}  y

    This is the discrete 2-D analogue of the first raw moment normalised
    by the zeroth moment (total mass), identical to the arithmetic mean
    of all foreground pixel (x, y) positions.

    Multi-object caveat
    --------------------
    If `binary_mask` contains more than one disjoint blob (e.g. two
    same-colour objects visible at once), this single centroid will fall
    somewhere BETWEEN them, which is generally not a meaningful position
    for either object. Run `morphology.label_connected_components` first
    and compute a centroid per component (via
    `morphology.component_properties`) for robust multi-object tracking.

    Implementation
    --------------
    np.nonzero(mask) returns the row (y) and column (x) indices of all
    non-zero pixels in two 1-D arrays of length |F|.  Computing the
    mean of each array with np.mean produces the centroid in O(|F|)
    time with no Python-level loop over pixels.

    Division-by-zero safety
    -----------------------
    When the mask is entirely black (|F| = 0) no centroid is defined.
    The function returns (-1, -1) to signal this to the caller rather
    than raising a ZeroDivisionError.

    Parameters
    ----------
    binary_mask : np.ndarray  shape (H, W), dtype uint8, values in {0, 255}

    Returns
    -------
    (cx, cy) : tuple of float  — centroid coordinates (column, row),

#  3.  Temporal Smoothing — Circular Buffer Frame Averager
# ============================================================

class TemporalSmoother:
    """
    Reduce temporal video noise by averaging the last N frames.

    Why a circular (ring) buffer?
    -----------------------------
    A naive implementation appends new frames to a list and discards the
    oldest:
        frames.append(new_frame)
        frames.pop(0)
        average = np.mean(frames, axis=0)

    list.pop(0) requires O(N) pointer shifts to move every element one
    position forward.  Appending reallocates when the list grows.  For a
    1080p RGB video at 30 fps with N = 10 frames this is ~186 MB of data
    to shuffle on every single frame — entirely unnecessary.

    The circular buffer pre-allocates a fixed 4-D tensor of shape
    (N, H, W, C) once at initialisation.  A single integer write_idx
    tracks where the next frame goes:

        write_idx = frame_count % N

    Writing a new frame is a single O(H*W*C) in-place assignment:

        buffer[write_idx] = new_frame

    The modulo operation maps frame_count onto [0, N-1] cyclically, so
    the oldest frame is always at position (write_idx + 1) % N and the
    newest at write_idx — without ever moving any data.  This gives
    O(1) amortised index arithmetic and one O(H*W*C) write per update,
    compared to O(N * H * W * C) for the list-pop approach.

    Averaging
    ---------
    The smoothed frame is the arithmetic mean across the temporal axis:

        I_smooth = (1/N) * sum_{k=0}^{N-1} buffer[k]

    Computed as np.mean(buffer, axis=0) in float32 to avoid uint8
    overflow (255 * N exceeds uint8 range for N > 1), then cast back
    to uint8 after clipping.

    Update the predicted state with a new measurement (Kalman update step).

    Mathematical formulation
    ------------------------
    Given a noisy measurement z related to the state by the observation
    model z = H @ x + noise, the update step corrects the prediction:

    Innovation (measurement residual):
        y = z - H @ state_pred

    Innovation covariance:
        S = H @ P_pred @ H.T + R

    Optimal Kalman gain (minimizes posterior error covariance):
        K = P_pred @ H.T @ inv(S)

    Updated state estimate:
        state = state_pred + K @ y

    Updated covariance:
        P = (I - K @ H) @ P_pred                          [standard form]
        P = (I-KH) P_pred (I-KH).T + K R K.T               [Joseph form]

    The Kalman gain K automatically balances trust between prediction
    and measurement based on their relative uncertainties (P_pred vs R).

    Numerical stability
    --------------------
    K is obtained by solving the linear system S.T @ K.T = (P_pred @ H.T).T
    via `np.linalg.solve` rather than explicitly forming `inv(S)` — this
    is the standard numerically-preferred pattern (avoids computing a
    full matrix inverse just to immediately multiply by it). For a small
    2x2 innovation covariance the difference versus explicit inversion is
    minor, but it is best practice and costs nothing here.

    The Joseph-form covariance update is used by default. It is
    algebraically equal to the standard form only when K is the exact
    optimal gain; under floating-point rounding (or a suboptimal/gated
    gain) it remains guaranteed symmetric positive semi-definite, while
    the standard form can drift slightly asymmetric or lose positive-
    definiteness over many iterations. Pass `joseph_form=False` to use
    the cheaper standard form.

class KalmanCentroidTracker:
    """
    Track a moving object's centroid using a Kalman filter.

    Why use a Kalman filter for centroid smoothing?
    -----------------------------------------------
    Simple temporal averaging (like TemporalSmoother) treats all frames
    equally and introduces latency proportional to the window size.
    In contrast, the Kalman filter:

    1. Provides optimal recursive estimation for linear-Gaussian systems
    2. Explicitly models object dynamics (e.g., constant velocity motion)
    3. Adapts to measurement quality via the Kalman gain
    4. Can predict position during temporary occlusions (no measurement)
    5. Has minimal latency — each measurement is processed immediately

    State-space model
    -----------------
    We use a 4-D state vector representing 2D position and velocity:

        state = [x, y, vx, vy]^T

    The constant-velocity motion model assumes:
        x(t+dt)  = x(t) + dt * vx(t)
        y(t+dt)  = y(t) + dt * vy(t)
        vx(t+dt) = vx(t)
        vy(t+dt) = vy(t)

    This yields the state transition matrix F (rebuilt per-call if `dt`
    varies — see `update`/`predict`):
        F = [[1, 0, dt, 0],
             [0, 1, 0, dt],
             [0, 0, 1, 0],
             [0, 0, 0, 1]]

    The observation matrix H extracts only position from the state:
        H = [[1, 0, 0, 0],      [x]     [x]
             [0, 1, 0, 0]]  =>  [y]  =  [y]

    Prediction/update lifecycle
    -----------------------------
    Each frame calls EITHER `update(centroid)` (measurement available)
    OR `predict()` (no measurement — e.g. occlusion), never both for the
    same frame. Both methods COMMIT the prediction step to
    `self.state`/`self.P` internally via a single shared `_step_predict`
    helper, so repeated `predict()` calls during an occlusion correctly
    propagate the object forward frame by frame using its last known
    velocity, rather than re-predicting one step from the same stale
    state every time.

    Tuning parameters
    -----------------
    process_noise (Q): Controls how much we expect the target to deviate
                       from constant-velocity motion. Higher values make
                       the filter more responsive to sudden accelerations.

    measurement_noise (R): Represents expected centroid detection noise.
                          Higher values make the filter trust predictions
                          more than measurements (smoother but laggy).

    Parameters
    ----------
    process_noise    : float  variance of process noise (default: 1e-3)
    measurement_noise: float  variance of measurement noise (default: 1e-1)
    dt               : float  default time step between frames (default: 1.0)
    gate_threshold   : float or None  chi-squared squared-Mahalanobis gate
                       (see `mahalanobis_gate`). None disables gating
                       (default). A common 2-D choice is ~9.21 (99%).

class MultiObjectKalmanTracker:
    """
    Track multiple simultaneous objects, each with its own Kalman filter
    and a persistent track ID.

    This is the natural next step once `morphology.label_connected_components`
    can produce multiple per-frame detections: a single `KalmanCentroidTracker`
    can only follow one object, so tracking several requires (a) one filter
    per object and (b) an association step that decides which detection
    belongs to which existing track each frame.

    Association strategy
    ---------------------
    This implementation uses greedy nearest-centroid assignment: at each
    frame, every (track, detection) pair is scored by Euclidean distance
    between the track's predicted position and the detection; pairs are
    matched greedily from smallest to largest distance, skipping any pair
    that reuses an already-matched track or detection, and rejecting a
    match if the distance exceeds `max_match_distance`. This is O(T*D log(T*D))
    and is simple and fast; a Hungarian-algorithm (optimal bipartite
    assignment) implementation would improve match quality when many
    tracks are close together, at higher implementation cost — a natural
    future upgrade using the same track bookkeeping here.

    Track lifecycle
    -----------------
    - A detection that matches no existing track spawns a new track.
    - A track that matches no detection this frame gets a `predict()`-only
      step (see `KalmanCentroidTracker.predict`) and its `missed` counter
      incremented.
